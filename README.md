# Web Dev Resources

A set of resources I have found useful in my web development journey thus far.

## JavaScript

[javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)

- In-depth reference to all things JavaScript. Includes a massive section on the JavaScript language, along with another large section on JavaScript in the browser. Should be a resource that is always consulted.

[MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript)

- Great reference material, tutorials, etc... Packed with examples and a complete reference to JS API's.

[Mastering JS](https://masteringjs.io/)

- Great tutorials about different parts of the JavaScript ecosystem, as well as newsletters appearing every 7-14 days on JS topics. A relatively new site (April 2019) this looks to be a promising resource.
