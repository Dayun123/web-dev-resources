# Web Dev Resources

A set of resources I have found useful in my web development journey thus far.

## General

[Awesome Falsehoods](https://github.com/jameslk/awesome-falsehoods)

- A curated list of awesome articles about falsehoods programmers make about things which are simply untrue.

[Destroy All Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts)

- Not exactly web focused, but looks amazing. Very deep stuff, some free lessons, but the core of the site is based on a $29 per-month subscription.

[WHATWG HTML Spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/)

- Not light reading, but a good reference to be aware of and to consult, especially when you are making a deep-dive into a topic.

[MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

- Great reference material, tutorials, API docs, everything you need to understand web dev.

[Joel On Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/)

- Great blog from the guy who founded StackOverflow.

## JavaScript

[javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)

- In-depth reference to all things JavaScript. Includes a massive section on the JavaScript language, along with another large section on JavaScript in the browser. Should be a resource that is always consulted.


[Mastering JS](https://masteringjs.io/)

- Great tutorials about different parts of the JavaScript ecosystem, as well as newsletters appearing every 7-14 days on JS topics. A relatively new site (April 2019) this looks to be a promising resource.

[Speaking JavaScript](http://speakingjs.com/es5/index.html)

- Older (2014) general JavaScript book that is free to read at the link.

[Go Make Things](https://courses.gomakethings.com/)

- Great pocket guides for learning VanillaJS. Also has some daily tips and other resources.

[WebDev Trick](https://webdevtrick.com/web-development/javascript/)

- Gallery of small JavaScript projects that have short demos and explanations. Great for getting inspired or learning new tricks.

## HTML

[Dive Into HTML5](http://diveintohtml5.info/index.html)

- Very cool online book devoted to exploring features of HTML5.
